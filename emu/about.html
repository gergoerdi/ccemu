<h1>About the Compucolor II Emulator</h1>
<p class="version">Version 2013.11.16</p>

<p>
This emulator is written in javascript, and makes use of some fairly
modern browser features, namely <tt>canvas</tt> support and the
<tt>FileReader</tt> API.  If your browser doesn't support those features,
the emulator may lose features or might not work at all.
</p>

<p>
This emulator is my first javascript program, and it leans heavily on
the work and encouragement of others.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>First off, thanks are due to David Jeppesen, who got this all started
        by giving me his old Compucolor.  I wanted one as the basis for
        writing an emulator.  I'm embarrassed to say that was back in 2002,
        and it has taken me over a decade to make good on my intentions.
    </li>
    <li>The code to emulate the 8080 CPU was written by
        <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/">Chris Double</a>
        for a
        <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/js8080/">space invaders</a>
        emulator, and he graciously gave permission to use it.
    </li>
    <li>Stefan Tramm improved on Chris Double's 8080 code by fixing a
        few bugs, then used it in his excellent
        <a href="http://www.tramm.li/i8080/">8080 CPU Emulator</a>,
        which emulates a running CP/M system right in your browser,
        including a TTY and floppy disks.
    </li>
    <li>The snazzy animation to make the debugger window open up and
        close, plus some behind the scenes logic to position elements
        when the virtual Compucolor II CRT is resized was done via the popular
        <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> core library.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.rit.edu/cla/philosophy/Suits.html">Dr. David B. Suits</a>
        didn't realize it, but he lit a fire under me to finally make the
        time to write this emulator.  I had spent nearly a decade with the
        intention of writing an emulator for the Compcolor II, but it never
        made it to the top of my priority list.  After contacting David about
        permission to scan his book, he pointed me at
        <a href="http://www.colandercombo.com/taxi/cc2.html">a more restricted javascript emulator</a>
        for a machine closely related to the Compucolor II.
        Although I didn't use any of that code, its shockingly small
        size made me realize that perhaps it wasn't as big of a job as
        I had feared; I began writing this emulator a couple days later.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2013.11.16</h3>

<ul class="changes">
    <li>added lower case character set mod</li>
    <li>added option to use v8.79 ROMs, although it is disabled in order
        to reduce the UI complexity</li>
    <li>the cursor now blinks in phase with blinking text,
        like the real machine</li>
    <li>refreshed the set of disk images released with the emulator</li>
    <li>fixed some bugs in the floppy emulation</li>
    <li>made an incompatible change to the virtual floppy disk format,
        and simultaneously re-released all the floppy images in that
        new format</li>
    <li>virtual floppy disk images can be saved using a more convenient
        mechanism on modern browsers (those supporting the File API)</li>
    <li>some very minor and obscure emulation modeling changes</li>
</ul>
